- 👋 Hi, I’m @SymphonySam but you can just call me Sam
- 👀 I’m interested in playing music, playing video games, and finding a way to merge these two aspects into one creative hobby.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to analyse data and how to code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making video games.
- 📫 You can find me on Bluesky @symphonysam
- 😄 Pronouns: any/all (currently undergoing a gender identification process/crisis(I promise I won't be offended by whatever you call me))
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've worked in the beer and alcoholic beverage making industry for the last 8 years. 

    Or is it 9.... 

    hmmmm..

    10 maybe? 

   Damn, I think it's 10 years now...

I don't feel that old.
I mean I'm only 29......3 times over....

I digress, I'm here to code, to learn, and above all; have a good time.
